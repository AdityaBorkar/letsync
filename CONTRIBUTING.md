# Contributing

We are a small community of contributors. We accept open source contributions, but before you start working, kindly contact the maintainers.

## Where to ask Questions?

Right now, we are a small community, hence we haven't created a Discord Server. Ask your questions directly on X or GitHub Discussions. DM / Tag me.
