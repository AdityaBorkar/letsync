# What is Replocal?

TanStack Query (FKA React Query) is often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze.

# Why Replocal?

Replocal is a tool that allows you to replicate your Replicate API locally.

# Package Design

We have designed the package functions to be separate for server-side and client-side to easily understand the server-side and client-side code. This does mean we have to write slightly more code, but we believe this is a small price to pay for the ease of understanding.
